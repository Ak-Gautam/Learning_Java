* Objects 

* Classes 

* Data abstraction and encapsulation 

* Inheritance 

* Polymorphism 

* Dynamic binding 

* Message passing
  
  

* Objects
  
  * basic run time entities in OOP
  
  * represents user defined data
  
  * interact by sending messeges to one another
    
    

* Classes
  
  * Entire set of data and code can be made into a user-defined datastructure called class.
  
  * each object in a class is associated with the same data type as that of the class
    
    

* Data abstraction and Encapsulation
  
  * wrapping up of data and function into a single unit is called encapsulation.
  
  * data can be accessed only by the functions of the class
  
  * insulation of direct access of data is called data hiding
  
  * Abstraction refers to representing the essential features without including background details
    
    

* Inheritence
  
  * process by which objects of one class acquires properties of another class
  
  * supports the concept of heirarchial classification
  
  * provdies reusability
    
    

* Polymorphism
  
  * the ability of operations to do different things based on the datatype of operands
  
  * supports operator overloading
  
  * extensively used in implementing inheritance
    
    

* Dynamic binding
  
  * refers to linking function call to the code to be executed in response to the call
  
  * code associated is not known until the time of call at run time
    
    

* Message passing
  
  * creating class
  
  * creating objects based on class definition
  
  * establishing communicaton b/w objects
  
  * a message for an object is a request for execution of a function
    
    

* Advantages of OOP
  
  * Through inheritance, we can eliminate redundant code
  
  * We can build programs from the standard working modules that communicate with one another, rather than having to start writing the code from scratch.
  
  * the principle of data hiding helps the programmer to build secure program
  
  * It is possible to have multiple instances of an object to co-exist without any interference.
  
  * It is possible to map object in the problem domain to those in the program.
  
  * It is easy to partition the work in a project based on objects.
  
  * Object-oriented system can be easily upgraded from small to large system.
  
  * Software complexity can be easily managed.
  
  * 

* Applications of OOP
  
  * Real-time system
  
  * Simulation and modeling
  
  * Object-oriented data bases
  
  * Hypertext, Hypermedia, and expertext
  
  * AI and expert systems
  
  * Neural networks and parallel programming
  
  * Decision support and office automation systems
  
  * CIM/CAM/CAD systems
